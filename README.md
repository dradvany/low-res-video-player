# Low-Res Video Player

Low-Res Video Player was made for artifact-laced media: re-encoded, unofficial rips, or heavily shared files. This viewer doesn’t upscale or clean up any of these traits--they are instead celebrated.

A dropdown menu allows for playback at viewport heights ranging from 144px to 720px. This speculative viewer doesn't really *do* anything, though it seems simpler to watch a blurry VHS rip through an interface that embraces the form of its contents.

## Technical details

- HTML & CSS handle layout and styling  
- Vanilla JavaScript does the rest: media control, drag-and-drop, and keyboard shortcuts  
- No libraries. No frameworks.

## Instructions

1. Download and open the HTML file in your browser (no internet required)  
2. Drop or upload a video file  
3. Enter browser’s fullscreen mode
