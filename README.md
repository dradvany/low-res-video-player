# Low-Res Video Player

Low-Res Video Player was made for media that has seen better days—grainy transfers, unofficial rips, or downloads the seedier ends of the web to name a few. Files that have been heavily-shared, re-encoded, compressed, and corrupted into an artifact-laced beauty—what Hito Steyerl calls a *“ghost of an image.”*  
This viewer doesn’t upscale or clean up any of these traits; it celebrates them and provides a space for videos to do what they do best.

A dropdown menu allows for playback at viewport hieghts ranging from 144px to 720px. Though this speculative viewer doesn't really *do* anything, it seems simpler to watch a blurry VHS rip on my desktop with an interface that embraces the form of its contents.

## Technical stuff

- HTML & CSS handle layout and styling  
- Vanilla JavaScript does the rest: media control, drag-and-drop, and keyboard shortcuts  
- No libraries. No frameworks.

## How to use

1. Download and open the HTML file in your browser (no internet required)  
2. Drop or upload a video file  
3. Enter your browser’s fullscreen mode
