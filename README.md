# Low-Res Video Player

Low-Res Video Player was made for videos that have seen better days—grainy transfers, unofficial rips, or downloads the seedier ends of the web to name a few. Files that have been heavily-shared, re-encoded, compressed, and corrupted into what Hito Steyerl calls a *“ghost of an image”*—an artifact-laden beauty.  
This viewer doesn’t upscale or clean up any of these traits; it celebrates them and provides a space to do what they do best.

A dropdown menu allows for playback at viewport hieghts ranging from 144px to 720px. Does this actually *do* anything? Not really. But it seems better watching a blurry VHS rip on my laptop with an interface that embraces its form.

### Example uses
- Viewing or reviewing degraded or archival footage on larger displays  
- Testing motion assets at varying sizes  
- Watching beloved video files—without distraction or clutter

## Technical stuff

- HTML & CSS handle layout and styling  
- Vanilla JavaScript does the rest: media control, drag-and-drop, fullscreen, and keyboard shortcuts  
- No libraries. No frameworks. Just open the file in your browser and drop in a video

## How to use

1. Download and open the HTML file in your browser (no internet required)  
2. Drop or upload a video file  
3. Enter your browser’s fullscreen mode and enjoy
